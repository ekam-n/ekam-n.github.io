      <p>Hi! I'm Ekam. Welcome to my personal website. I'm an Interactive Arts and Technology major at Simon Fraser University. I'm passionate about videogame design and development, as well as playing videogames (of course). I also love to get active in the gym and with sports like soccer and basketball.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <div id="education-content">
        <h3>Bachelor of Science, Simon Fraser University</h3>

      <div id="projects-content">
        <h3>Volt Legacy</h3>
        <p>Project for a course, "Digital Games: Genre, Structure, Programming and Play". This was a fun introductory class where I learned how to implement game physics and basic game design. The class culminated in a final project where I made a multi-level challenging platformer game.</p>

        <h3>Controlled Chaos</h3>
        <p>Project for a course, "Introduction to Technological Systems". This was the first class where I had the opportunity to integrate hardware with software. My group and I created an interactive mixed-reality racing game where users control a custom-built RC car which triggers electronic quizzes that the user must complete with a laptop and connected touch sensors.</p>
        <p>My role in this project included most of the technical aspects. For example, I was responsible for constructing the RC car and connecting it using Bluetooth and the Arduino microcontroller to a PS5 controller.</p>
