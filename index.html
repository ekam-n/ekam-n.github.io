      <p>Hi! I'm Ekam. Welcome to my personal website. I'm an Interactive Arts and Technology major at Simon Fraser University. I'm passionate about videogame design and development, as well as playing videogames (of course). I also love to get active in the gym and with sports like soccer.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>

        <h3>Bachelor of Science, Simon Fraser University</h3>

        <h4>Major in Interactive Arts and Technology</h4>

          <h5>Digital Games: Genre, Structure, Programming and Play</h5>
            <p>This was a fun introductory class where I learned how to implement game physics and basic game design. The class culminated in a final project where I made a multi-level challenging platformer game.</p>
            <p>Each level introduced new mechanicsm, challenged the player on pre-existing ones, and tied it all together.</p>
          
          <h5>Introduction to Technological Systems</h5>

            <p>This was the first class where I had the opportunity to integrate hardware with software. My group and I created an interactive mixed-reality racing game where users control a custom-built RC car which triggers electronic quizzes that the user must complete with a laptop and connected touch sensors.</p>
            <p>My role in this project included most of the technical aspects. For example, I was responsible for constructing the RC car and connecting it using Bluetooth and the Arduino microcontroller to a PS5 controller.</p>
