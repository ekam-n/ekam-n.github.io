## AI Assistance Declaration

This project utilized AI assistance from OpenAI's GPT-4 model, specifically through the ChatGPT tool, to support development in the following ways:

1. **Code Explanation and Debugging**: The AI was used to provide explanations and insights into JavaScript, specifically the `document.createElementNS` function and how it works within the SVG namespace.
   
2. **Problem-Solving**: The AI provided solutions and guidance for structuring SVG-based code, including best practices for generating and manipulating elements within the DOM using JavaScript.
   
3. **Documentation**: Assistance was provided in structuring documentation and improving readability, including this very section of the README.
   
4. **Creative and Technical Advice**: The AI contributed suggestions for integrating recursive and mathematical principles like BÃ©zier curves and fractal patterns into the project's SVG art design.

The AI was used as a supplement to my own understanding and development, aiding in streamlining the coding process and offering alternative approaches where necessary. All final decisions were made and implemented by me.
