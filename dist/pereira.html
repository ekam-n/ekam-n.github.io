          <h2>A Captivating Rivalry</h2>

            <p>Adesanya had words for Pereira in a 2018 interview with Sporting News Australia.</p>
            <p id="izzy-quotes"> “No one knows who the f*ck he is" "When im a legend, he’s going to be at some pub talking some sh*t about I beat that guy one time"</p>
            <p>Pereira did not take that too kindly...</p>
            <p id="pereira-quotes">“There is…an interview with Israel Adesanya that motivated me so much.” “I felt challenged. And whenever there is a challenge, no one can hold me back”</p>
          </div>
          <div> <!--Adesanya v Pereira-->
            <p>Pereira focused in on MMA, where he dismantled his competition. He was fast-tracked to the UFC and a match against current UFC Middleweight Champion and past rival, Israel Adesanya.</p>
