      <p>Here are the visualizations I made for Assignment 3 of my class, Introduction to Visual Analytics. In this assignment, 
        we were given a dataset tracking sales of videogames. The dataset records certain details about each copy sold of every game. 
        These include: genre of the game, region the copy was sold in, when the copy was sold, what platform the copy was sold for, etc. 
        We were told to make some visualizations to show certain relationships between the data. 
      </p>

      <h2>Global Sales by Genre, for Each Platform</h2>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis1"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The clearest trend is the popularity of the Action and Sports genres on almost all platforms. The Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, PS2, are the best-performing platforms by a significant margin to any other platforms. One interesting thing I noticed is that the Shooter genre is the most popular genre for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC, but not for any other platforms. This might suggest some unique quality that is shared among these platforms and not the others. 
      </p>

      <h2>Sales Over Time, by Genre</h2>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis2a"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The Sales Over Time by Genre graph shows that the popularity of all genres largely increased from the 90s to the 2000s, suggesting across-the-board increase in interest in videogames. 
      </p>

      <h2>Sales Over Time, by Platform</h2>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis2b"></div>
      </div>

      <p>The Sales Over Time by Platform graph shows a similar increase in sales for most platforms from the 90s to the 2000s.
      </p>

      <p>An interesting observation is that you can see the popularity of each PlayStation console increase, then decrease as the subsequent PlayStation becomes more popular. This suggests increased brand loyalty amongst PlayStation players, compared to Xbox, where the popularity of the Xbox and the Xbox One are not comparable to that of the Xbox 360.
      </p>

      <h2>Regional Sales, by Platform</h2>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis3"></div>
      </div>

      <p>For the most part, all the regions seem to have most of the same consoles as their favourites: PS2, PS3, Wii, and DS. However, some of the Nintendo (Japan-made) consoles are more popular in Japan than they were in other regions, unsurprisingly. Consoles the SNES and N64. And the American Xbox consoles are insignificant in Japan, compared to other regions. 
      </p>

      <h2>Sales Of Genres in Japan Over Time</h2>
      <h3>Role-Playing</h3>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis4a"></div>
      </div>
      <p>For a very long time, Role-Playing has been the dominant genre in Japan. I was surprised to learn this, especially since the Action genre is more popular worldwide. 
      </p>

      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis4b"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Randomly in 2006, the “Miscellaneous” genre of games became extremely popular. This is a bit puzzling, as I am not sure what would have caused this meteoric rise and fall, but interesting, nevertheless.</p>

      <h3>Action</h3>
      <div class="vis-container">
        <div id="a3-vis4c"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Action games are starting to / have already surpassed Role-Playing games in popularity in Japan.
